## Intro
This is my attempt to learning how crypto currencies work in bigger scale following Snakecoin implementation.
## Future Implementations
*The hashlist can be replaced with Merkle tree DS.
*Run & visualize it using flask.
## Current Challenges
The line between the 'frontend' and the 'backend' is blurred.
